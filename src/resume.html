<div class="resume">
    <p>I have over 15 years of experience in the software industry, most recently working as a tech lead and backend engineer.</p>

    <p>
        I'm more of a problem-solver than a technologist: I try to keep a business perspective in software discussions and provide technical insight to non-engineers.
        I tend to assume a leadership role in the teams I integrate, leading by example and from experience rather than title.
        Because I think that software development is primarily a human activity, I place a high value on effective communication and knowledge sharing.
    </p>

    <p>I designed, developed, and operated large-scale distributed systems using various technologies and programming languages (Python, Erlang, Rust, JavaScript, AWS, PostgreSQL).
        I also have significant experience in technical writing, legacy modernizations, project management, DevOps, and full-stack web development.
        I write about software on <a href="https://olano.dev/blog/">my blog</a> and have published several Open-Source Software <a href="https://olano.dev/projects">projects</a>.
