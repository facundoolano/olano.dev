** Background

Early in my career, when I was working at a Java shop, there was a lot of buzz about /enterprise applications/. You would use Java /Enterprise/ Edition to apply Patterns of /Enterprise/ Architecture, implemented through /Enterprise/ Java Beans. It wasn't clear to me what made some applications more /enterprise/ than others, or why following a specific set of ceremonies was supposed to yield more adequate solutions to their problems. I tended to dismiss these programming concepts that seemed to exist exclusively inside the Java +echo chamber+ ecosystem.

I shortly moved away from that Java shop and from Java programming in general to work with other languages on a few web apps, a media outlet, an MTG online community, a SaaS provider, an ad tech company, a crypto startup, then an AI one[fn:1]. Last year I took what I would call a less pretentious, more [[https://boringtechnology.club/][technologically boring]] job in the healthcare sector. The challenge in this new company comes not from scale or growth or sophisticated tools but from the complexity of the domain---from the need to design an organization, and consequentially a software architecture, that automates and eventually simplifies its business processes.

This shift in focus is why I went back to the basics and have been reading about [[software-design-is-knowledge-building][knowledge building]] and [[unit-testing-principles/][testing-as-design]]. It was through that /Unit Testing/ book that I finally came to terms with the /enterprise application/ concept:

#+begin_quote
An enterprise application is an application that aims at automating or assisting an organization’s inner processes. It can take many forms, but usually the characteristics of an enterprise software are
-  High business logic complexity
-  Long project lifespan
-  Moderate amounts of data
-  Low or moderate performance requirements
#+end_quote

This sounded like a pretty accurate description of what I work on at my current job,
especially when contrasted with what I did before. Given the kind of challenges I currently face---fleshing out business processes, reconciliating terminology, breaking apart the legacy monolith, figuring out what the domain entities are and who should own them, etc.---a natural next step for me was to take another look at Domain-Driven Design.

** Strategic Design

I picked up Vlad Khononov's /Learning Domain-Driven Design/ as a modern alternative to the classic Eric Evan's blue book. It summarizes and updates the same ideas, and finally relates them to newer techniques like microservices, event-driven architecture, and data mesh. The first part, /Strategic Design/, covering the core DDD concepts, was the most useful for my purposes.

*** Definitions

- A *business domain* defines a company’s main area of activity, the service the company provides to its customers. A company can operate on multiple domains or change them over time.
- A *subdomain* is a fine-grained area of business activity. All of a company’s subdomains form its business domain. From a technical perspective, subdomains resemble sets of interrelated, coherent use cases. Such sets of use cases usually involve the same actor, the business entities, and they all manipulate a closely related set of data. Domain-driven design distinguishes between three types of subdomains:
  - A *core subdomain* is what a company does differently from its competitors. This may involve inventing new products or services or reducing costs by optimizing existing processes. A core subdomain that is simple to implement can only provide a short-lived competitive advantage. Therefore, core subdomains are naturally complex.
  - A *generic subdomain* is a business activity that all companies are performing in the same way. They are generally complex and hard to implement but battle-tested implementations are widely available.
  - A *supporting subdomain* is one that supports the company's business without offering a competitive advantage. Supporting software has low business logic complexity and therefore, it's cheaper to implement.

| Subdomain Type | Competitive advantage | Complexity | Volatility | Implementation     | Problem     |
|----------------+-----------------------+------------+------------+--------------------+-------------|
| Core           | Yes                   | High       | High       | In-house           | Interesting |
| Generic        | No                    | High       | Low        | Buy/adopt          | Solved      |
| Supporting     | No                    | Low        | Low        | In-house/outsource | Obvious     |

- *Domain experts* are knowledge authorities in the software’s business domain. They are either the people coming up with requirements or the software’s end users. The software is supposed to solve their problems. Systems analysts and engineers are transforming their mental models of the business domain into software requirements and source code.
  - A software project’s success depends on the effectiveness of knowledge sharing between domain experts and software engineers.
- An *ubiquitous language* is the terminology that describes the business domain, shared between all project related stakeholders. It's intended as a means for communication between domain experts and the project team members, removing the need of translations and intermediaries (system analysts, product owners).
  - It should consist of business domain-related terms, not technical jargon.
  - It should be consistent, without ambiguous or synonymous terms.
  - It should be constantly evolved and validated.
  - It should be cocreated between domain experts and team members. The preexisting business language used by experts may not be effective for domain modeling.
- Since the ubiquitous language needs to be consistent and reflect the domain expert's mental model, but different domain experts can have conflicting models, the language is divided into smaller languages with specific areas of application, called *bounded contexts*.
  - Defining the scope of a ubiquitous language---its bounded context---is a strategic design decision. The larger the boundary, the harder to keep it consistent; the smaller, the more integration overhead the design induces.
  - each bounded context should be implemented as an individual service/project.
  - each bounded context should be owned by one team only
- A bounded context is different from a subdomain.
  - both are ways of decomposing a business domain.
  - Subdomains are /identified/ as part of the business domain analysis. They are a set of use cases that are discovered.
  - Bounded contexts are /designed/ to model the business as smaller, more manageable problem domains.
- TODO bounded context integration patterns:
  - partnership
  - shared kernel
  - conformist
  - anti corruption layer
  - open host service
  - separate ways

*** Commentary

1. I find the distinction of core, generic, and supporting subdomains useful to build heuristics for technical decision making, e.g. to decide where it's worth investing[fn:2]: if you're investing in sophisticated software development outside your core subdomain, you're probably doing it wrong. And if you don't know what your core subdomain is then you are in trouble!

2. I wholeheartedly sympathize with the pursuit of an ubiquitous language. I find it impossible to build a mental model of the business while juggling with synonyms and conflicting definitions.

3. Since subdomains and domain experts will necessarily need slightly different views and terminology, I see the value in the notion of the bounded context to ensure internal consistency.

That being said, I find big challenges in trying to carry out the strategic design techniques in real world settings:
   - it places too much expectations on domain experts to articulate their business knowledge and to provide, directly or indirectly, the requirements of the software.
   - much like traditional Agile methodologies, it assumes fluid communication between the development team and the software users. <But companies tend to put intermediaries (product owners or software analysts) in between[fn:3]. it's hard to carry the intention to build bounded context through these intermediaries.

Some of these challenges are mentioned in the book, but without offering satisfying solutions, perhaps because those depend on organizational direction more than on the software design process. <In my experience, the default is for stakeholders to lack the incentives and the involvement in the software development process to make DDD successful. I can only imagine two scenarios to apply the methodology in practice:
  - The company direction is already sold on DDD and can mandate the domain experts to collaborate: the organizational the supports this development strategy /by design/.
  - The software designers are on their own, and need to do what the book calls /undercover DDD/. In this case, they can leverage the software itself as a tool to favor DDD. <For instance, instead of trying to convincing stakeholders to adopt a consistent domain language, promote it by using it in software that stakeholders are already compelled to adopt for the capabilities it offer.

Beyond the co-creation of a shared language, I believe the best outcomes stem from a feedback loop between domain experts and software designers: designers should be constantly incorporating business knowledge from the experts, but also, [[a-note-on-essential-complexity][ideally]], become catalysts for change, e.g. not just capturing domain processes and rules but discovering opportunities to simplify them.

** Applying DDD
- my least favorite part of the book is where it describes tactical design
- I found it too prescriptive, too pattern-y, perhaps too indebted to the original applications of the DDD ideas that, coupled with some of the patterns for Enteprise architectures described in Martin Fowler's book.

- This part converge in to a design heuristics decision-tree, where the subdomain type and a few other attributes cascade into each design decision (data modeling, application architecture, testing strategy):

- I should stress that the tone of the book is not dogmatic, heuristic usually come with the required disclaimers.
- but nevertheless, the problem is that the discussion and the emphasis is still put on specific techniques rather than in the principles they derive from. I found the techniques of little applicability in my day to day, so I was hard to keep up with the discussion.

As an example, the book discusses low level data modeling patterns like Transaction Script, Active Record, and Domain Model.
- any real world project that I've worked on professionally had a recommended, standardized stack: e.g. the data managed by Django, Rails, SqlAlchemy, etc. So I'm much less interested in seeing implementation details of a domain model or active record, than in seeing what are the principles behind using one or another, so I can try to bend my available tools to get some of those benefits, without having to sell a tech stack change /in addition/ to selling the domain-driven design model.

** Relationships With Other Models

The book starts to pick up again by the end of Part III when it tackles evolving design decisions and how to implement DDD in "brownfield" projects.
  - TODO review topics: eg. how to sell DDD or how to do it undercover, or to partially.
- I can't help but feel the ordering here is backwards. In 2025 (or, to be fair, 2021, when the book was published) I wish the literature would stop assuming greenfield projects by default.
  - maybe I'm looking for something like arch modernization

- I unexpectedly found a lot of value in the last few chapters, when the DDD approach is integrated with other methodologies, even if I'm not using any of them.
- The chapter on microservices, in particular, was one of the best treatments I've seen of the subject, putting it not only in the context of DDD but of modular design as explained by John Ousterhout and of the work by one Glenford Myers, to whom we owe this gem:

#+begin_quote
There is much more to the subject of complexity than simply attempting to minimize the local complexity of each part of a program. A much more important type of complexity is global complexity: the complexity of the overall structure of a program or system (i.e., the degree of association or interdependence among the major pieces of a program).
#+end_quote

- the treatment is similar to this earlier blog post, although I prefer the one in the book.
- /Learning Domain-Driven Design/ worked well as a refresher of the DDD core concepts and to familiarize with a few techniques I'd only knew by name. <I didn't get quite as much as I was expecting in terms of applicability to my day to day job, but the last few chapters convinced me that the author is onto something. I found out that he recently published a more principled book on software design, so I'll definitely be checking that one out.

*** Notes
[fn:1] Which, read like that, kind of explains why I ended up needing a career break.
[fn:2] This is similar to the "innovation tokens" idea from /Choose Boring Tech/.
[fn:3] Understandably: more often than not, engineers are unwilling or unprepared to talk in non technical terms; more often than not, business people lack the patience of the time to deal with engineers.
