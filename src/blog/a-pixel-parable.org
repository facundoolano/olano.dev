"How would you like working as a video game artist?"

Mark is holding his "Best of the Show" certificate on one hand and the guy's card in the other. /Art Director - LucasFilm Games/. LucasFilm as in George Lucas. As in Star Wars.

"Could you come over to the Ranch for an interview?", he insists.

This is his second lucky break of the weekend. Mark is just out of art school, trying to make it as an illustrator. A friend recommended he show up to this sci-fi convention, he said these things are good for networking. Mark wouldn't mind having some of his work on a trading card, or a rule book, or, who knows? on the cover of one of those fantasy novels he used to read growing up.

So he shows up to the convention on Friday, someone notices his work---these pencil-drawn landscapes that look like they were hand-painted---, they invite him to participate in the convention's art show, he does, two days later he wins best of the show. That was his first lucky break that weekend; the second was this guy, Gary, coming over to him, handing him a card, asking him to 'audition' for a video game job.

Mark reads the card again, stops for a second to think what to say next. He needs a job, after all. Honesty has been working wonders for him this weekend, so he tells it straight:

"I'd be happy to come over to do <anything at all there> but... I don't know the first thing about video games. I never even touched a computer."

"That's alright", Gary replies, "we've had better results teaching artists how to program than programmers how to art. I'm not worried about that part."

The last two hours of the convention are a blur. He drives back home, trying to figure out what just happened. <On his first weekend, on this first try as a professional illustrator, he's offered to interview for a job that he didn't even know existed five minutes ago, but that he now thinks it's indisputably his dream job---and one that he's terribly underqualified for.

Mark calls his parents to share the news. His father, he now learns---and this was the third and final lucky break of the weekend---has just bought a personal computer.

"What are you doing with this thing, anyway?", asks Mark. His sitting in front of the computer, skimming the manual. The cover reads /Atari 520ST/.
"The school made a deal for us to get them at half price. They say we should be computer-literate if we want to have a job in five years." The voice comes into the room before the rest of his father, who then appears at the doorway, leaning on the frame. "I figured I could use it for writing, but they have a different brand at school, so I can't print my files. And I'm not buying a printer. You can take it if you want."

"Let's see if I get the job, first. It says there should be a drawing program somewhere in here, 'NeoChrome'. Let's try that out." It takes them 20 minutes of collaborative effort---something they haven't done since his father thought him to change the oil of the car a decade ago---to find the disk and open the program. Then Mark drops the computer manual and switches to the NeoChrome one. Another half hour later, Mark is dropping little green dots across a blue background.

Mark secludes himself in his old high school bedroom for the next few evenings, getting familiar with this computer thing and the paint program. The little mouse forces his hand into a claw. Whenever he begins to feel that he's gotten used to it, that he can forget about the tool and focus on the task, whenever his eyes seem to spark a connection between the image on the screen and the image on his brain, his hand jumps from the mouse to grip a pencil that's not there, like a phantom limb.

He teaches himself to draw a single picture, a little African hut that he repeats over and over until he memorizes the procedure, which he will repeat a few days later to survive his interview.

<Mark walks out of the garage and meets Gary at porch of the stable house, where the games group has its headquarters. He shows him around the office, introducing him to everyone they meet in the way, and takes him to his desk.
Across from him sit Ron and Dave, the programmers he'll be working closely with.
There's not one but two computers in there, both different to the AtariST he used last week
a DOS one where he'll do most of his work and a c64 that runs the games they just published
why are we targeting two computers? why /these/ two and no others
historical reasons, they'll eventually do DOS and let external studios do the porting to other platforms
you'll notice that PCs are unforgiving for graphics works, they were intended as business machines, but the processing power is much better, there's already an upgraded graphics mode but not many people have it at home yet so we'll focus on EGA for now.

they help him setup both computers
<the only thing you need to know about the c64 is how to turn it on and run these two games
<gary shows him around deluxe paint. the idea is similar to the neochrome program he already knows, with some difference in the brushes (this is what professionals use)
<there's a manual
<he notices both have fewer and certainly uglier colors than the atari

his imposter syndrome kicks in, once and again, and he takes notes and constantly apologizes for his questions and the obvious things he doesn't know.
they reassure him again, even the ones that have been user computers for a few years
they are all trying to figure out what it means to tell a story in this medium, in this genre, no one is an expert at that
an artist perspective is what they expect him to bring to the table, the tools he'll just figure out. they are changing all the time, anyway

after lunch, ron sits with him to play maniac mansion, ron shows him how to move around, how to talk with the characters, how to solve a puzzle to progress the story
there's a newer game they've been working on Zak MacKracken, dave's game,
and his job is going to be help adapting the c64 backgrounds to the EGA ones. But for now, it's best that he just spends a few days playing the first game, to get and idea of what they are trying to do. He says, again, that he's no game, and Ron says that that's perfect, they want to build something that just about anyone can pick up and have fun with

<drives out
<hatchback honda civic
<relief that leave it underground instead
place that looks as otherworldly as one of his fantasy landscapes, as a shot from Star Wars
the main house with its library and spiral staircase clearly inspired the game they showed him today
<a <valley>, a lake, green hills
observatory
vineyard
<cattle, farm animals
he will be driving in this underground garage for the next three years, but he'll make a point of never taking this for granted, no matter how shitty the job gets

# FIXME mention hotsopts, remove definition from below

it doesn't take him too long to become productive. that is, to work out a usable background fast enough to meet the developers expectations, which were lower than his own.
his goal was to produce art and get paid for it, so he give as little thought as possible to the needs of the project and the business.
it's convenient that they don't expect much from him, because not only he isn't satisfied with his production and it doesn't come close to art, he still feels he has a long way to go to tame the computer, the mouse, the pixels, the palette, and the drawing program.
<at first he tried just working out from the c64, but soon finds out that creates more problems than it solves, since the screen dimensions are different
he develops some 'coping mechanisms': he first makes sketches, plotting the pixel grid in a ruled notebook, to try options before moving to the computer screen where nothing seems to flow, where everything feels clumsy and rigid, like lego building, and it's hard to tell whether something's going to look good before it's done.

the most frustrating is encoding the pictures in those suffocating 16 colors, always the same palette for anything he may need to represent---black, dark gray, light gray, white, dark blue, light blue, cyan, yellow, mustard brown, dark red, poppy red, peach, magenta, acid-hot pink, grass green, and acid-chartreuse.
this is another thing where he needs to plan ahead, carefully measuring what colors he gets to spend, a decision he needs to make early on and that informs---constraints--- all the rest of his choices: the scene composition, the mood, what's shown, what's hinted.
<There's little room for the sort of creativity that stems from impulse and experimentation (but much from constraints, pushing the boundaries, happy accidents that lead to innovation
it gets better as /he/ gets better, more familiar with the tools; once he grasps what are his materials and what their capabilities and limitations, he can start using them to his advantage---work around and step on the constraints and push himself to be creative as with any art and any material, just like does with pencil and paper.

Mark catches his first glimpse of the little guy during lunch on his third week
they only see him at the restaurant when he has visits
david and gary start listing the famous people they saw
this time is spielberg
you'll understand, of course, that while it may appear that they are right there across the room, we're worlds apart
galaxies
galaxies apart, thank you
they are holograms, inaccessible to us, like the Leia message on the first movie
in fact, you should know that we should be the holograms here, and under no circumstances should we be noticed by Lucas or his guests, or any film related people
especially not Lucas

truth is Lucas doesn't care for video games, the existence of the division a sort of accident from a different era of the company,
his survival also a corporate accident, after the graphics group---now pixar---was sold to steve jobs another
we're pretty much the last hackers around, a kind o intruders
an <unstated rule> was to be as invisible as possible to lucas, not to remind him we exist, spending his money and---worse--occupying one of his buildings

he only showed up once in the stable house, to talk with Steve Arnold
<to make up for his absence, the executives throw around the single piece of advice they managed to get from the owner: “Stay small, be the best, don’t lose any money.”
that's our gospel, right there.

<our man steve, on the other hand, is our biggest fan. we see much more of him over at Games
<he's just nuts about tech. sometimes it feels like he's more into this whole place than Lucas
<he'd probably live in the ranch if he wasn't busy, you know, making <hits|movies>
<wonder if lucas will bother to make one for a change

spielberg used to call Ron on weekends for /Maniac Mansion/ hints
so yeah, I bet he'll get involved in one of the games sooner than later
and Indy game, probably
when the tech is good enough
and when they get back the license
right, when we get the license

<that part he already knows, he learned on the first or second day: ironically, lucasfilm games doesn't own the license to make indiana jones nor star wars games.

the games division is expected to come up with original ideas, which is both a blessing and a curse,
it gives them freedom to be creative but they have to live up to the LucasFilm standards (and sales) without the automatic sales of a popular license.
the only ip they get can their hands on are the <> left over props they use as office decor

The mouse, the pixels, the 16-color palette, the hotspots, are the constraints he needs to work with and around. The programmers, too, with their arcane knowledge, can become another layer of constraints, a kind of the extension of the computers.
TODO: maybe use an example requirements for a particular zak scenario for this section. (that would require killing the paragraph above

One trick---a /hack/, as programmers would call it---he discovered early on was that if he formed a checkerboard pattern of pixel in his drawings, when he zoomed out the image pixels would blend and bleed in the screen, producing shades beyond the boring old 16 colors of the EGA palette.

This was one of those happy accidents, but since he found it he's been thinking how to use it to his advantage, and this background could be the perfect excuse.
<todo describe how he draws it, where he uses dither
<this was obviously not art, not yet, but it was better that anything he did before and anything he saw in the previous game; most importantly it was progress, it was a hint of path they could explore to get closer to his goal.
he sends it/takes it to the programmer, goes over to his desk to see their reaction and get some praise, we're taking the art on this game to a new level folks, he's expecting a pat on the back

the image loads up on the screen from top to bottom. ron takes a few seconds to look at it before speaking up

# FIXME dont throw dithering as it's an already known term

"what the hell man?"

"I... wait, what?"

"You dithered all over this thing, this won't compress." He speaks in his soothing monotone, which makes him all the more scary when the words imply he's not happy

"Dithered?"

"What's up", Gary joins them, sensing trouble. "Wow, neat <background>. Oh, wait, that won't compress. Yeah, you can't do that."

"What's compression, again?"

"Those little patterns there, you can't do that, that will take too much space."

Gary tries to be didactic in these situations, not to because he cares that Mark learns about the computer internals but because he wants to make sure Marks gets they have good reasons to clip his wings. Gary proceeds to explain that the image data is run through a compression algorithm so it takes up less storage in the disk. The idea is that instead of storing the colors pixel by pixel, they store how many times the current color needs to be repeated; the more same-color segments the image has, the fewer space it will take in disk. His little checkerboard technique---which they called /dithering/---completely breaks this idea, possibly making the compressed image take /even more/ space than the original. Dithered backgrounds would double or triple the required disk space, which would double the amount of disks required to ship the game, which would double production costs, which would double the game's price tag, which would surely get them all fired.

# FIXME: maybe too explanatory
Those damn computer. It's like they come with a set of unwritten instructions that everyone knows about but him. He's almost 6 months into the job and still can't tell when he's doing it right. How is he supposed to /be the best/ without /don't lose any money/ getting in the way?

"Try again with solid colors, please." Gary pats him on the back. "That was some background, though, huh?"

<veterans had warned him there was going to be crunch when they got closer to the
<here's the thing about deadlines: everybody knows we won't hit the first one or two deadlines, and that's ok, but everyone accept that you'll just crunch those final months
mark defaulted to a belligerent attitude towards authority and thus was, in principle, against overtime and having to meet executive demands and meet deadlines
but, also, he didn't really mind the effort.
he never once lost sight that
he was getting paid to be an artist---even though he didn't felt these computer drawings were there yet---
he was paid handsomely, more than every
he was having fun, he respected his teammates,
he was working at geek disneyland,

he was already used to working late, in the quite months they would take long lunches or hikes through the hills or they would toss a softball around in the field out back, so they ended up working late to make up for the time
most of the people on the team was in their early twenties so they didn't have anywhere better to be anyway

so as the project deadlines arrived, they just kept working late, only skipping the long breaks during the day.

weekends at the ranch, though, were off-limits. they would let him take his computer back home on fridays to work during the weekend
he figured his bodily reaction to screen time was somehow connected with sleep deprivation. at first, pulling 6 or 8 straight hours in front of the computer seemed to burn him out, but after 10 or 12 he didn't really cared, he just kept going until he literally felt asleep on the keyboard

during this periods he got used to taking breaks from the works without getting away from the computer. he always kept one or two personal illustrations on the side, where he <got off> from all the restrictions that the game backgrounds imposed on him
he would use dithering, and colors otherwise reserved for sprite characters, and unconventional image dimensions

protest dither image,
this was... art. and now hi was annoyed that he couldn't put stuff like this in the game. he set it as a screensaver in his computer to send a passive-aggressive message, a kind of protest---against no one in particular, no one in his team, anyway. Ge was protesting Turing and Von Neumann and George Lucas and Ronald Reagan, for making it so damn hard to make art for a living.

takes a long lunch, when he gets back to his desk the divsion director and gilbert are discussing, why exactly doesn't dither compress? can't we do anything about this? art like this in our games would be a game changer, the differential people came expect from our films, now in the computer.

# TODO: maybe some compression technical details

a few week later he was informed that dithering was now supported. he realizes the programmers too have their own set of constraints, their own challenging puzzles they need to resolve to get some creative output from these machines

the division head told him they would double down on dithering for the look and feel of the next game, that he would be lead artist for it. your <stock> just went up.

around that time, they received two corporate messages: 1- they recovered the rights to use the indiana jones license. 2- they should start on an indy game now, for the 3rd entry spielberg was shooting

the devs got a copy of the script and there were some screenings at the main house
some of the folks even got to visit the set
purcell came back with a whip for "research purposes", which they incorporated to their afternoon sporting activities

mark was relieved, if a little worried, that they let him continue with loom while most of the people switched to indiana jones
he was suspicious of IP games, he prefferred originals
he could see how the designers were struggling to make everything fit the movie script and still be playable
nobody was sure what the interest could be if people already knew the plot
from an artistic point of view it would've been restraining as well
and they certainly weren't about to toy with his dithering stuff with such a tight deadline
this was just a money making game

it was obvious that once the star wars license embargo was lift off, it would take a hell of an effort to prevent the suits to send all hands to milk chewbacca

#+begin_export html
<br/><br/>
#+end_export

# FIXME this should be a (brief?) loom section
# probably no much gain to lead it with the gospel thing
“Stay small, be the best, don’t lose any money.”

the only part of this that affected him, Mark thought, was /be the best/, and that was how he intended to operate anyway, he didn't need a manager to tell him. he left to the suits, though, to figure out how his work and that of his teammates was supposed to be connected to the money making.

he assumed things went well enough, as projects were still lined up, now they were doing two adventures in parallel
by all appearences they were getting bigger, new artists coming in, and mark had to help onboard them
they actually did two games in parallel now, and new people were coming in

it was a good thing that he didn't get assigned to this indy game.
they made him lead bg artist for another project, that would be all ferrari style, doubling down on his dithered style

this time around he doesn't just adapt someone else's rooms, he gets to design them by himself

other than compression, the scumm engine now could scale the character sprites to represent different distances, this meant that he could move away from the horizontal axis and add perspective to his scenes

maybe: onboarding new artist scene?
still dont like computers but dpaint is his domain
wants to show how he does thing, but not be prescriptive, letting the artist figure out his own style

<monkey project
ron had been circling this memo on game design around the office, why our games suck
he could sense this was his attempt at putting those ideas to practice
it was mostly a game design thing, it didn't affect the graphics, didn't directly affect him, but it was Ron's side of /be the best/ and Mark just felt he should follow suit and apply everything he'd been learning so far and push it to the next level
<besides, everyone does everything

They invite him to join the brainstorming sessions, they ask for his input on design decisions, his water cooler jokes make it to the dialog of the game. They give him freedom to figure out the game backgrounds, handing him a short list of requirements for each one---items and doors that will be necessary for the gameplay of the scene, what they call /hotspots/---and as long as he meets them he can do whatever he wants.

<something special about this new team and this new game
they were having so much fun with this one, and that stimulated them to try harder and do better, that surely had to show in the final thing

# maybe set this scene specifically in the unboxing
# this wasn't the only thing changing, he was just too busy to connect the dots
things start to change around while they are finishing monkey island, he was just to busy to pay attention

- receives an internal email about the rebrand
  - TODO: what's the technical org change?
- the mail also mentions something everybody knows about, like there was a "writing on the wall"/sword of damocles hanging in the office wall: the star wars embargo lift. most people loved star wars and couldn't be more excited about getting their hands on their property for a videogame. mark also loved the movie, but he struggled not to see that date as a death sentence for the creativity of the studio

a few weeks ago everyone got new vga computers, his is still boxed in his desk, he didn't have the time to set it up and he wasn't going to use it for monkey anyway, the vga port is another project and he won't be involved in that one

- todo: lookup specs. what will we do with all of this power?
- todo: unpacking and setting up scene
- at first it felt like his independence day, finally free from that EGA cage.
  - but soon he felt he wasn't sure what he was doing anymore, the palette choices weren't as relevant anymore, so he had to rethink his whole process
  - these new computers were like a career reset for him
- he could see some of the new folks, don't even remember their names, working on VGA ports for their old games, some "upgrading" his loom and monkey island backgrounds.
  - the results were more colorful, yes, but also less vivid, they lacked the personal style, the touch of the artist, that was lost in translation.
  - each pixel on his dithered patterns was loaded with his intent, now dpaint did most of the thinking through a generic color gradient

    #+begin_export html
  <br/><br/>
  #+end_export

- for his first lucas arts game he got assigned a new Indiana Jones adventure, from left over scripts, which was probably worse
- the cool kids went on to work on the monkey island sequel
- now they were doing hand painted backgrounds, then scanned in photoshop on a Mac and moved to dpaint for cleaning up
  - it was funny that 3 years ago this would've made life much easier to old mark, it would kept most of his work in illustrator land and much less in computer land
  - but now it meant that a lot of he had to learn, a lot of the craft he acquired, was now irrelevant
  - he went from industry expert on to just another illustrator, not a particularly good, young or productive one .
  - the originals by peter chan were gorgeous but the results in the screen were filled with random noise, it would take time to figure out a polished look for the new technique
- discussed with someone
  - it finally felt like we got a hang of this thing in monkey island, that we could push it beyond its limits, but now is like we need to start over
  - "a technology is always at its best right before it's obsolete, man"
  - who said that? I don't know but he's right
- that made total sense to him, he could easily see the pattern: they'll always be cornered by new developments, always chasing after the new hot thing
  - after scanners it would be compact discs or rgb color or those three dimentional things they were developing over at the ILM <basement/freezer?> or over at pixar
  - more colors, more space, more processing power but also more complexity, more time to get familiar and competent with the tool, let alone creative or innovative.
    - it would take them more time to find the boundaries of the tech and thus longer to squeeze some art out of them,
    - and they'll obviously lack that time, it won't be long before the next computer generation arrives

- last day at skywalker ranch packing his box into the car
- box had: Indy and Chewbacca action figures, a Sam & Max comic book, his sketch books, the dpaint manual he hadn't read in ages---by now he could have written his own, a much better one---, a weird set of pencils he hand picked to aproximate the 16 EGA colors, he might as well toss those <actually toss them instead of thinking>.
- the computer was already in the trunk of his car.
  - he was used to take it home on weekends, and he preferred to bring it himself on monday as an excuse to pick his cubicle
- it was a typical corporate move to rebrand to lucas "arts" in the name just as they move it out from the ranch to a <cubliced> office plan over at san raphael,
- lined up a bunch of generic star wars projects, they started bringing in more people, boring technicians, no more rebels, just stormtroopers
- maybe should do like purcell, and just freelance and do his own thing, work for other companies, maybe go back to traditional illustration
- he knew it didn't get better than making adventure games at skywalker ranch, that he wouldn't find what he had there anywhere else, much less as a freelance artist
- but he also knew he wouldn't get it here either, lucasfilm was gone, replaced by lucas arts, no more ranch, the magic/halcyon days were over / the dream/fantasy was over
- he ran out of lucky breaks
- drive out, evoke his first day
   still owns the same old honda civic

I feel the stage sets we rendered as best we could for those earlier games conveyed all sorts of personal artistic style and evocative atmosphere, while most of the 3d game environments that came after them seemed almost universally airless, lightless, and rendered in such a uniform 'algorithmic' art style.

I think we lost things---important things--- whenever accelerating technological fixes and agendas overtook, and to some extent eclipsed, human creative navigation and intent.

had chosen to center his film-making operation in Northern rather than Southern California, much closer to Silicon Valley than to Hollywood.

Lucasfilm, the owner of Star Wars, had a games division that wasn’t allowed to make Star Wars games

“We’re trying to produce an experience that’s like being part of a film, rather than just being part of a game.
#+end_quote

he Games Group got moved from their nondescript offices in San Rafael to nearby Skywalker Ranch, the “filmmaker’s retreat” at the very heart of George Lucas’s empire. They were housed in an ornate structure of Victorian brick called the Stable House, with crackling fireplaces in almost every room. Later, old-timers would tell newcomers stories of the Games Group’s time at Skywalker Ranch, which would last for just a few years, like legends from before the Fall: catching a sneak preview of a new David Lynch film in the company of Lynch himself in the Ranch’s beautiful 300-seat art-deco theater; hanging out on a regular basis with Steven Spielberg, who wanted to play everything the Games Group had in development every time he stopped by, sometimes for hours at a stretch; playing softball on the Ranch’s gorgeously manicured field with rock star Huey Lewis; hiking up to the observatory after a long day at the office to do another sort of stargazing; eating gourmet lunches every day at the Ranch’s restaurant for $5 a pop.

providing production services to the film industry (Industrial Light and Magic, Skywalker Sound) and making mass-market entertainments. The old Computer Graphics Group that had awkwardly spawned the Games Group still hadn’t really proved themselves to belong in the former category, while the Games Group, at least if you squinted just right, pretty much did belong in the latter. Thus, while the Games Group got to remain at Lucasfilm, the Graphics Group in February of 1986 was spun off to a collection of investors that included many of their own current personnel as well as, as ringmaster of the whole proceeding, Steve Jobs

Soon the old Games Group represented the only significant hacker presence left at Lucasfilm. It was during this period of colossal change that George Lucas took rare personal notice of Games for long enough to deliver his most oft-quoted piece of advice to Steve Arnold: “Stay small, be the best, don’t lose any money.” This commandment has often been taken to represent a sort of creative carte blanche for Arnold and his charges. Taken in the context in which it was uttered, however, it’s probably better seen as a warning. The Games Group was free to continue to trade on the Lucasfilm name and enjoy their gourmet lunches at the company cafeteria, but they’d have to start paying their own way from here on. Should they fail at that, their rope would not be a long one, for Lucas had little personal investment in their work.

 Driving much of the design was a philosophy that adventure games should be friendlier, less tedious, and much less deadly than was the norm from competitors like Sierra.

We believe that you buy games to be entertained, not to be whacked over the head every time you make a mistake. So we don’t bring the game to a screeching halt when you poke your nose into a place you haven’t visited before. In fact, we make it downright difficult to get a character “killed.”

 Each of the guilds of craftspeople which Bobbin visits over the course of the game is marked by its own color scheme: the striking emerald of the Guild of Glassmakers, the softer pastoral greens of the Guild of Shepherds, the Stygian reds of the Guild of Blacksmiths, and of course the lovely, saturated blues and purples of Bobbin’s own Guild of Weavers.

a mandate came down from Lucasfilm Games’s parent company’s management: they wanted an adventure game to go with the upcoming film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Such a mandate was unusual for the privileged little artists’ enclave that still was Lucasfilm Games at this time,

  Some start using it as a defense mechanism only after being slapped in the face by the game a few times, the rest just stop playing.

   major corporate reorganization was in progress at Lucasfilm, which saw the games division given far more resources — their personnel roll grew from about 25 to more than 100 between 1989 and 1991 — but also given much closer supervision.

Ron Gilbert, a comedy writer by disposition and talent, found the need to play it relatively straight particularly frustrating, but it seems safe to say that all of the designers’ creative instincts were somewhat hemmed in by the project’s fixed rules.

if you’ve seen the movie — and it seemed safe to assume that just about everybody who played the game had seen the movie — what’s the point in walking through the same story again in game form? The
