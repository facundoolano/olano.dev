/Following up on my [[a-computing-magazine-anthology][previous post]] on pending project ideas, today I want to write about an [[https://github.com/facundoolano/rpg-cli][rpg-cli]] spin-off. rpg-cli is one of my fondest personal projects and I never properly documented its development, so I'll start this post off by doing just that./

** The simplest thing that could possibly work

This was back in 2021. I was going through one of those periods where I wasn't getting much intellectual satisfaction out of my daily job, so I thought I could use a programming side project. I had an itch to work on a video game, something I hadn't done in a while.
In the past few years I had finished many classic Japanese RPGs---/Final Fantasy VI/, /A Link to the Past/, /Chrono Trigger/, /Suikoden 2/, /Final Fantasy Tactics---/ so I felt compelled to try something with that genre. But I like personal projects to be short-lived and yield something usable, somewhat finished, after a few months; I wasn't going to embark on a full game development project on my free time.

I've played JRPGs long-enough that I don't pay much attention to the characters or the plot anymore; I like the pretty pixels, yes, but most importantly I'm drawn to its underlying systems. Explore the map, visit cities, clear dungeons; kill monsters, level up, buy equipment; character stats, turn-based combat, leveling system. To me, classic JRPGs are pure mechanism, a kind of puzzle. Was there some way of getting the fun out of building such a mechanism---of solving that puzzle---, wrapping it with the minimal amount of functionality, the simplest thing that could possibly pass as a video game?

In other words: how much could I have peeled off, and still gotten an RPG? One answer was obvious: no dialogues, no plot, no story[fn:2]. But that wouldn't be enough: the big  blocker were the graphics, I needed to work around them in all their rabbit-hole, yak-shaving glory. I had just seen how the /Final Fantasy Tactics/ designers had fit most of the standard RPG elements, save the battle sequences, into menu screens. Could I have done something in that direction?
If it was today, I'd consider building a mini game with PICO-8 or an ASCII roguelike. At the time, I went with a trick that [[https://github.com/facundoolano/advenjure][had worked for me]] before: replacing the graphics with text.

Only that, you know what's narrower than a text user interface?

A command-line interface.

Was there any way I could make a role-playing game fit in the shell?

** Your file system as a dungeon
This was one of those cases where formal constraints foster creativity. I derived many design decisions from restricting myself to a command-line interface.

The shell is the /environment/ of command-line programs; the file system gives a sense of /place/. At some point I made that connection and decided that the hero of my game would /inhabit/ the file system, with the working directory as its current location. Changing directories would be like moving between dungeon levels, enemies popping up along the way: the more nested the directory, the tougher the enemies. As in many early CRPGs, the goal of the game would be just to crawl down the dungeon, as deep as possible. Going back ~~~ (home) would restore the hero's health and give the player a chance to buy equipment and supplies.

This idea finally clicked when I imagined the program as a ~cd~ replacement, where players would randomly engage in turn-based combats as a side effect of doing their daily work in the terminal:

</div>
#+END_EXPORT

A pure command-line interface also meant that the gameplay would had to be non-interactive. This was a problem for the traditional turn-based combat I had in mind. Its solution was inspired by /Suikoden 2/, a PlayStation game I had recently finished.

In /Suikoden 2,/ you manage a huge list of playable characters (over 100), in parties of up to six members. When enemies pop up in dungeons, having to issue six commands on each turn, with characters you haven't been using for long, can get tedious. The developers had the good sense to introduce an /auto-battle/ button that just repeats the basic attack of each party member, until the enemy is killed.

So I decided to make this auto-battle feature the default for rpg-cli. This /felt right/ to me because I'm a very dull player when it comes to combat. I don't particularly enjoy strategizing, I just default to punch with warriors and spell with wizards, with the occasional healing potion in between, until enemies become tough-enough that they force me to stop and think. So I would bake that pattern right into rpg-cli's battle logic: default to attack, unless HP is low and a potion is available. (I later extended this to account for magical classes that attack with spells and occasionally need to restore their magical points).

This would obviously remove some player agency (and fun) from the combat; the opportunity to make choices and strategize would need to happen in between battles: deciding whether to go further down the dungeon or back home to recover, when to use items, how to spend the gold, etc.

** Research

I felt that the radical simplicity I started from had unexpectedly led me to an interesting concept for the game, so I decided to double down on "the simplest thing that could possibly work" as my design mantra, applying it to the entire project, not just the interface.

I had a concept, an implementation language, a scope and a rough outline of the interface for my program. But, before I could start coding its basic building blocks, I needed to design the RPG model: a stat system to know what attributes to give to the characters, a leveling system to know how to raise them, and a combat routine that would put them to use.

My experience of the genre was almost exclusively through JRPGs, so it felt appropriate to do some research, to see if I could get ideas from western video games and tabletop RPGs: had someone else already figured out the minimum set of stats to make an RPG work? is there a canonical set of enemy classes? Would I benefit from learning the /Dungeon & Dragons/ rules?

I started by looking around for tabletop RPGs designed for minimalism or genericity:
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS][GURPS]], the Generic Universal role-playing System.
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWERPS][TWERPS]], the World's Easiest role-playing System.
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinky_Dungeons][Dinky Dungeons]], the smallest RPG ever produced[fn:1].
  - [[http://www.campaignmastery.com/blog/introducing-the-sixes-system/][The Sixes System]], a Minimalist Universal RPG.
  - [[https://www.perilplanet.com/freeform-universal/][FU]], the Freeform Universal RPG.
  - [[https://www.stargazergames.eu/warrior-rogue-mage/][Warrior, Rogue & Mage]], a simple, lightweight RPG.

Fun and educational as that excursion was, it left me more confused than when I started. I concluded that tabletop rulesets would contribute complexity rather than simplicity to my project, so I went back to using video games as my reference. In addition to the ones I was already familiar with, I spent some time reading about /Rogue/ and its descendants since, from the little I knew about them, it sounded like they could teach me some things about minimalist design:
  - [[https://web.archive.org/web/20050206091120/http://www.wichman.org/roguehistory.html][A Brief History of "Rogue"]].

  - [[https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/the-key-design-elements-of-roguelikes--cms-23510][The Key Design Elements of Roguelikes]].

Finally, I looked at some RPG design resources. The most useful were the [[https://howtomakeanrpg.com/][How To Make an RPG]] series, particularly the entries on [[http://howtomakeanrpg.com/a/how-to-make-an-rpg-stats.html][stats]] and [[http://howtomakeanrpg.com/a/how-to-make-an-rpg-levels.html][levels]].

** Pseudo-historical digression
I didn't know it back then, but there is an illustrious tradition of deconstructing the role-playing game. RPG video games came from tabletop RPGs, that came from war games, that came from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriegsspiel][Kriegsspiel]], a simulation game that the Prussian army trained with during the 19th century[fn:3]. Like its war gaming ancestors, /Dungeons & Dragons/ was full of complexity: sophisticated rules for character building, catalogs of monsters and spells and armor, and battle outcomes decided by probability calculations. This was arguably part of the fun, at least for some of the players---for others, a complicated system is an invitation to simplify and abstract.

It's no secret that there was some overlap between early RPG players and computer programmers; crucially, a significant portion of the privileged few people with computer access in the late \'70s were /Dungeons & Dragons/ players. It didn't require much of a mental leap to try to combine the two; at first to offload number crunching to the computer, eventually to create the solo playing experiences that were the first computerized RPGs.
This process culminated in /Wizardry/ and /Ultima/, the two franchises that dominated computer gaming in the \'80s.

Over at Japan, the Enyx designers combined the dungeon crawling from /Wizardry/ and the over-world exploration of /Ultima/, adjusting them to the limitations of the Famicom/NES console---and the tastes of the local public.
With a linear story, streamlined systems focused on battles, and a more forgiving difficulty, /Dragon Quest/
became the blueprint of what would become the Japanese RPG genre. Shigeru Miyamoto offered his own interpretation in /The Legend of Zelda/, with a shift towards arcade action and a leveling system reified into a heart count. A decade later, the Blizzard North team would reinvent role-playing in the PC by removing most of its ceremony. Drawing heavily from the roguelikes, /Diablo/ simplifies character setup and stats, and generally removes anything that could stand in the way of slashing monsters and grabbing loot.

In retrospect, looking at tabletop RPGs felt backwards because, by instead using the video games I already knew as models, I was benefiting from decades of RPG system simplifications---half the job had already been done.

** Design

I wanted the least amount of stats that would allow battles to work non-deterministically enough to be fun.
Inspired by TWERPS, I briefly considered having a single stat to determine both inflicted damage and available hit points, but that resulted in dull battles, so I went instead with the classic ~hp~ and ~strength~ stats. Later, when outlining the battle routine, it became apparent that I would also need a ~speed~ stat to mimic the turn based style of games like /Final Fantasy/; that is, rather than having each character attack in round-robin, the fastest characters would get turns more frequently. Those minimal attributes were reflected in the [[https://github.com/facundoolano/rpg-cli/blob/d4c90252db34a04e9abb7e96623c62d6fe47edfe/src/character.rs#L15-L27][early version]] of the ~Character~ struct:

#+begin_src rust
pub struct Character {
    pub name: String,

    pub level: i32,
    pub xp: i32,

    pub max_hp: i32,
    pub current_hp: i32,

    pub strength: i32,
    pub speed: i32,
}
#+end_src

Items and equipment was another area that I found could be automated. Items would be bought at the home directory, with a ~rpg-cli shop~ subcommand, or found in chests, by inspecting directories with ~rpg-cli ls~. Equipment would be generic and level based; instead of a Wooden Sword, a Bronze Blade, or a Steel Saber, players would have a ~sword[1]~ and a ~shield[1]~ available at the shop from the start, a ~sword[5]~ and a ~shield[5]~ unlocked when the hero reached level 5, an so on. Stronger equipment would automatically replace its weaker equivalent when bought or found, removing the sell-old-buy-new toil of traditional JRPGs. Healing items would be similarly level-based.

When I eventually imported the permadeath feature from roguelikes, I decided to drop a tombstone with the items and equipment at the directory where the character died, to give some sense of progress and to make it more feasible to unlock end-game features.

** Development
As soon as I started prototyping, I learned that I couldn't control the shell working directory from my program (something obvious if you think about it, but that I hadn't considered before). The solution was for the program state to track its own "path to current hero location", and use a function to sync the shell to it:
#+begin_src shell
rpg () {
    rpg-cli "$@"         # forward arguments to rpg-cli
    cd "$(rpg-cli pwd)"  # move shell to the hero's location
}
#+end_src

The hardcore version would be to overwrite the built-in ~cd~ function, so that enemies would pop up as the user changed directories:

#+begin_src sh
cd () {
    rpg-cli cd "$@"
    builtin cd "$(rpg-cli pwd)"
}
#+end_src

Other commands like ~rm~, ~mkdir~, or ~touch~, could be similarly aliased to integrate with the game. These usage patterns paved the way for [[https://github.com/facundoolano/rpg-cli/blob/da433ff186ba32e86c386e049b3f68e0b6c7de80/shell/README.md][further options and flags]], to show the game state at the shell prompt, write scripts, and build custom gameplay flows.

Once I got the core of the game working as I originally planned, I started using it as a canvas, loosening up on minimalism, porting features I liked from other games: character classes, burn and poison status ailments, a quest to-do list, hidden enemies, easter eggs, and a final boss. This is what the [[https://github.com/facundoolano/rpg-cli/blob/da433ff186ba32e86c386e049b3f68e0b6c7de80/src/character/mod.rs#L16-L36][character struct]] looked like after those additions:

#+begin_src rust
pub struct Character {
    pub class: Class,
    pub level: i32,
    pub xp: i32,

    max_hp: i32,
    pub current_hp: i32,

    max_mp: i32,
    pub current_mp: i32,

    strength: i32,
    speed: i32,

    pub sword: Option<Equipment>,
    pub shield: Option<Equipment>,
    pub left_ring: Option<Ring>,
    pub right_ring: Option<Ring>,

    pub status_effect: Option<StatusEffect>,
}
#+end_src

The character classes are defined in a [[https://github.com/facundoolano/rpg-cli/blob/f2d37631628461ee192864e464e2088415e3866c/src/character/classes.yaml][yaml file]] that can be overridden by the user to customize the game. Here's an excerpt:

#+begin_src yaml
- name: warrior
  hp: [50, 10]
  strength: [12, 3]
  speed: [11, 2]
  category: player

The [[https://github.com/facundoolano/rpg-cli/blob/da433ff186ba32e86c386e049b3f68e0b6c7de80/src/game.rs#L86-L106][~Game::go_to~]] function shows how directory traversal is mapped to player movement and enemy spawning:

#+begin_src rust
/// Move the hero's location towards the given destination, one directory
/// at a time, with some chance of enemies appearing on each one.
pub fn go_to(
    &mut self,
    dest: &Location,
    run: bool,
    bribe: bool,
) -> Result<(), character::Dead> {
    while self.location != *dest {
        // set the hero's location to the one given
        // and apply related side effects.
        self.visit(self.location.go_to(dest))?;

        if !self.location.is_home() {
            if let Some(mut enemy) = enemy::spawn(&self.location, &self.player) {
                // Attempt to bribe or run away according to the given options,
                // and start a battle if that fails.
                if self.battle(&mut enemy, run, bribe)? {
                    return Ok(());
                }
            }
        }
    }
    Ok(())
}
#+end_src

To wrap up, see below the full definition of [[https://github.com/facundoolano/rpg-cli/blob/f2d37631628461ee192864e464e2088415e3866c/src/game.rs#L266-L316][~Game::run_battle~]], the auto-battle routine at the core of the game. This is a good synthesis of the game; in a sense, the rest of the code exists as support for this function:

#+begin_src rust
/// Runs a turn-based combat between the game's player and the given enemy.
/// The frequency of the turns is determined by the speed stat of each
/// character.
///
/// Some special abilities are enabled by the player's equipped rings:
/// Double-beat, counter-attack and revive.
///
/// Returns Ok(xp gained) if the player wins, or Err(()) if it loses.
fn run_battle(&mut self, enemy: &mut Character) -> Result<i32, character::Dead> {
    // Player's using the revive ring can come back to life at most once per battle
    let mut already_revived = false;

    // These accumulators get increased based on the character's speed:
    // the faster will get more frequent turns.
    let (mut pl_accum, mut en_accum) = (0, 0);
    let mut xp = 0;

    while enemy.current_hp > 0 {
        pl_accum += self.player.speed();
        en_accum += enemy.speed();

        if pl_accum >= en_accum {
            // In some urgent circumstances, it's preferable to use the turn to
            // recover mp or hp than attacking
            if !self.autopotion(enemy) && !self.autoether(enemy) {
                let (new_xp, _) = self.player.attack(enemy);
                xp += new_xp;

                self.player.maybe_double_beat(enemy);
            }

            // Status effects are applied after each turn. The player may die
            // during its own turn because of status ailment damage
            let died = self.player.apply_status_effects();
            already_revived = self.player.maybe_revive(died, already_revived)?;

            pl_accum = -1;
        } else {
            let (_, died) = enemy.attack(&mut self.player);
            already_revived = self.player.maybe_revive(died, already_revived)?;

            self.player.maybe_counter_attack(enemy);

            enemy.apply_status_effects().unwrap_or_default();

            en_accum = -1;
        }
    }

    Ok(xp)
}
#+end_src

I like that, after a few years, I still find it reasonably self-explanatory.

** Postscript: A text interface for rpg-cli

Having to rely on preexisting directories to make progress in the game can quickly get tedious. I ended up using [[https://github.com/facundoolano/rpg-cli/tree/da433ff186ba32e86c386e049b3f68e0b6c7de80/shell#arbitrary-dungeon-levels][a function]] that created directories on the fly; other players scripted the movements to skip the initial grinding to level up. The file system integration turned rpg-cli into a curiosity, but it was more of an afterthought, a consequence of making the game fit into a command-line interface. Internally, the code converts paths into abstract  locations and uses a "distance from home" notion to determine things the enemy level and frequency.

As soon as my RPG model felt right, I started toying with the idea of trying it on a different interface. The obvious choice would be a rogue-like text interface, displaying symbolic ASCII characters in the terminal.
To make it work, the main adjustment would be to turn "distance from home" into the dungeon floor level, and let enemies appear when moving around. I was curious to experiment with procedural level generation, while preserving most of the simplistic rpg-cli design choices (basic classes, generic items and random automatic battles).

I started played [[https://github.com/tmewett/BrogueCE][Brogue]] and picked up a [[https://www.routledge.com/Procedural-Generation-in-Game-Design/Short-Adams/p/book/9781498799195][book on procedural generation]], looking for ideas. I scoped the project and did some [[https://github.com/facundoolano/rpg-tui][some prototyping]] but eventually dropped it, in part because I wasn't as interested in Rust programming anymore but mostly because I was trying to document the development process (of both rpg-cli and this new rpg-tui), which turned out to be too distracting---I was more interested in the writing than in revisiting an old project. This post was based on some of the notes I took along the way.

** Notes
[fn:2] As John Carmack said: “Story in a game is like story in a porn movie. It's expected to be there, but it's not important.” I don't generally agree with this, but it's one valid way to look at video games, and it happened to fit  the restrictions I set myself for this project.
