It's been over two years since I published and [[reclaiming-the-web-with-a-personal-reader][first wrote]] about [[https://github.com/facundoolano/feedi][feedi]], my personal feed reader.

I experimented with a few new features but, most importantly, was confident to just remove anything that didn't feel necessary.
