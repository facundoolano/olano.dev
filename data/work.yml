        As part of the Real-time bidding team, I worked on design, development, maintenance and operation of the bidding service and its support systems.
        These were decade-old systems, deployed to 2000 servers across the world, with high traffic and low latency restrictions.
        Operations work included infrastructure set up, deploys, monitoring, and production incident handling.

        I assumed informal leadership of the team during its 3x growth and collaborated in projects with internal and external stakeholders (Engineering, Product, Legal, Supply, Ad Exchanges, Service providers).

        <br/><br/>Some of the work efforts I led at NextRoll:

          <ul>
            <li> Streamline and automate new exchange integrations, a process that went from a couple of months to a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Automate several periodic operational tasks, in particular reducing deploy time from 6 hours to 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> Modernize and decomission legacy systems.</li>
            <li> Implement a tool to assess canary deploy health from DataDog metrics, using Pandas.</li>
            <li> Profile and optimize the server performance with the specific goal of infrastrcuture cost savings.</li>
            <li> Redesign, prototype and future-proof systems in preparation for privacy-related changes in the Ad Tech industry.</li></ul>
