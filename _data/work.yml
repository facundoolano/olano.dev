    As part of the Real-time bidding team, I worked on design, development, maintenance and operation of the bidding service and its support systems.
     These were decade-old systems, deployed to 2000 servers across the world, with high traffic and latency demands.
     Operations work included infrastructure set up, deploys, monitoring, and production incident handling.


     Some of the work efforts I led at NextRoll:

       - Streamline and automate new exchange integrations, a process that went from a couple of months to a couple of weeks.
       - Automate the production deploy processes, reducing its time from 6 hours to 45 minutes.
       - Modernize and decomission several legacy systems.
       - Automate periodic tasks such as AMI and release package preparation.
       - Implement a system to pull canary deploy metrics from DataDog and process them with Pandas to diagnose canary deploy health.
       - Profile and optimize the server performances with the specific goal of infrastrcuture cost savings.
       - Redesign, prototype and future-proof systems in preparation for privacy-related changes in the Ad Tech industry.
