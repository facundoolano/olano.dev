     As part of the RTB (Real-time bidding) team, I worked on feature design and development, maintenance and operation of the bidders and their support systems.
     These were decade-old systems, deployed to 2000 servers across the world, with high traffic and latency demands.
     In addition to design and development I worked on infrastructure set up, deploying and monitoring, and handling of production issues and outages.


     Some of the work efforts I led at NextRoll:

     - Streamline and partially automate the exchange integration setup, a process that went from a couple of months to a couple of weeks.

     - Decommission or simplify several legacy pieces of the architecture.

     - Automate the production deploy processes, reducing its time from 6 hours to 45 minutes.

     - Automate periodic tasks such as AMI and release package preparation.

     - Implement a system to pull canary deploy metrics from DataDog and process them with Pandas to diagnose canary deploy health.

     - Profile and optimize the server performances with the specific goal of infrastrcuture cost savings.

     - Redesign, prototype and future-proof systems in preparation for privacy-related changes in the Ad Tech industry.
